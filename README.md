# RJOPointOfSale
My attempt at a Point of Sale system. Main focus is on the register interface, ringing up items and using Sockets to simulate sending customer order information the other screen in a restaurant. 


If you are cloning a copy of this project, ensure that:

1) You are connected to the internet when running the project. This project utilizes ElephantSQL, and requires an internet connection to access the database in which the employee, entree, side and beverage information is stored. 

2) You use the sample employee code 12457 to access the register interface.
